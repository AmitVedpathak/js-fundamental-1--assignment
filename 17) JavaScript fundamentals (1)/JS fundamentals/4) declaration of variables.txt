In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data in a program. Declaring variables allows you to reserve memory space for a specific type of data and gives a symbolic name (identifier) to that memory location, making it easier to reference and manipulate the data throughout your code.

The let keyword is one of the ways to declare variables in JavaScript

Syntax for declaring variables using let:
	let variableName;
Example :
	let message;
	message = "Hello, World!";
	console.log(message); // Outputs: Hello, World!

In this example, a variable named message is declared using the let keyword. The variable is then assigned the value "Hello, World!" and is printed to the console.

You can also declare and initialize a variable in a single line:
	let greeting = "Hi there!";
	console.log(greeting); // Outputs: Hi there!

The let keyword is block-scoped, which means that a variable declared with let is only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which it is defined. This contrasts with the var keyword, which is function-scoped. Using let helps prevent certain issues related to variable scoping and hoisting.

Example of block scope with let:
	{
	    let x = 10;
	    console.log(x); // Outputs: 10
	}

	console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined

It's important to note that when declaring variables with let, you can change the value of the variable later in the program:

let count = 5;
count = count + 1;
console.log(count); // Outputs: 6

 Variables provide a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data, enabling the creation of dynamic and responsive programs.
